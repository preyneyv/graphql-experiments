## Overview

*Experiments IDE* is a visual query builder for GraphQL. It is a tool for
developers to allow rapid prototyping and easy exploration of their GraphQL
schemas, while also having uses in end-user code-less development.

## What's Inside?

### Experiments IDE
Experiments is the complete IDE. It lets you create and run your queries
against a GraphQL server. Try the live demo (TBD). Experiments can be embedded
as-is into other websites and projects.

### Experiments Editor
Experiments Editor is the drag-and-drop node-based query builder that is used
by the Experiments IDE. It can also be included by itself into other projects
where the IDE's features are not desired. 

## Eventually
- A Visual Studio Code extension.
